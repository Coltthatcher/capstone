Colton Thatcher 
Project-Name: Workout planner
Project's Purpose or Goal: The goal of this project is to have a space where you can set workout goals and setup a plan for yourself and how you want workouts to go.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Minimum features.
Users will be able to add new workout goals to a personalized plan
there will be a number of workouts provided with pre coded data users can choose from
Users will be able to create new workouts, edit them and delete them depending on what they are looking for.
a.k.a Full Crud.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

Jsx, javaScript, React
I wish to use the soundcloud API also so users can add certain music to the workout plan. I think that will be more of stretch goal than MVP though.


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Soundcloud API so users can add music to plans.
Possibly authentication so users can have accounts
I think pictures for workouts wont be a problem, but possibly adding videos to the site (I have absolutely no idea how to do that so we will see)

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
Again Soundcloud API requires an API
I haven't dabbled to far into react besides what is taught in the lessons. I don't think i will need to use a database but it is possible i may need to go down that route.

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
Im excited to have creative control over something! I think a lot of the stuff i need to do is going to make more sense to me as I start implementing them.

NOTES FOR CAPSTONE STUDY AND PURPOSE.



Function components are literally functions that returns a React element. They can't store or alter state. We will mostly write function components.

Class components are classes that extend React's Component class. They must always include a render() method that will return a React element. They are used when we need state.

Nesting components is a big part of developing with React. Components can be parents, siblings, children or any combination thereof.

Small, modular components are the way to go. This makes our code easier to understand and allows us to separate presentational concerns.


NOTES on State:
state is anything that will be stored and changed.
adding new workouts is a change of state.

State can be changed props can not (at least components can not change the its props)

only define components as classes if it 100% requires state.

Local state will live inside a single component so only in the component that is using it.

Workout Control will be parent component of everything
it will need a class component.

CAPSTONE LOG (for Research Recording ) see above (NOTES FOR CAPSTONE STUDY AND PURPOSE.) for notes taken during the study period.

Starting at 3:14-3:25 educating myself on state more, to further plan how my project will interact component wise.
start reviewing these lessons.

started to plan out authentication with react took a break in between started watching video around 5:30 took a break after 5:50 started watching again around 9pm total amount of work 1 and half hour ish.
watched this video

doing extra study to see if I wanna end implementing other features and comparing that to if I will have enough time.

1) Get Base site running.
2) Have seeded workout already so users can choose a list. without having to create any work outs.
3)  Have crud ability so users can add new workouts.
4)  Add edit ability to workouts.
5) Add delete ability to workouts.
6) Create a personal plan section.
7)Users can add a personalized list of workouts in a workout plan section.
8)Users can access the soundcloud API to add mixes to their personal workout page.
9) figure out what the heck is going on with using the soundcloud API
10) have the music section be interwoven with the personal page. 
11) styling (not sure on when i should try implementing)
