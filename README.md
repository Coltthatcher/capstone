Colton Thatcher 
Project-Name: Workout planner
Project's Purpose or Goal: The goal of this project is to have a space where you can set workout goals and setup a plan for yourself and how you want workouts to go.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
Minimum features.
Users will be able to add new workout goals to a personalized plan
there will be a number of workouts provided with pre coded data users can choose from
Users will be able to create new workouts, edit them and delete them depending on what they are looking for.
a.k.a Full Crud.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

Jsx, javaScript, React
I wish to use the soundcloud API also so users can add certain music to the workout plan. I think that will be more of stretch goal than MVP though.


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
Soundcloud API so users can add music to plans.
Possibly authentication so users can have accounts
I think pictures for workouts wont be a problem, but possibly adding videos to the site (I have absolutely no idea how to do that so we will see)

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
Again Soundcloud API requires an API
I haven't dabbled to far into react besides what is taught in the lessons. I don't think i will need to use a database but it is possible i may need to go down that route.

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
Im excited to have creative control over something! I think a lot of the stuff i need to do is going to make more sense to me as I start implementing them.

NOTES FOR CAPSTONE STUDY AND PURPOSE.



Function components are literally functions that returns a React element. They can't store or alter state. We will mostly write function components.

Class components are classes that extend React's Component class. They must always include a render() method that will return a React element. They are used when we need state.

Nesting components is a big part of developing with React. Components can be parents, siblings, children or any combination thereof.

Small, modular components are the way to go. This makes our code easier to understand and allows us to separate presentational concerns.
