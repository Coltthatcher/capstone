Project-Name: Goal
Project's Purpose or Goal: The goal of this project is to have a space where you can set workout goals and setup a plan for yourself and how you want workouts to go.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Minimum features.
Goal will have a working app page, there will be a homepage, and information on how to subscribe. The sites purpose will be presented.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

the tools used to make my mvp will be minimal/ have a feeling i can start implementing other things when i have at least the MVP working.
Jsx, javaScript, React, React native, React Icons, Vscode, Npm, 

(stretch goals API and sql or firebase)
I wish to use the soundcloud API also so users can add certain music to the workout plan. I think that will be more of stretch goal than MVP though.
I would like to implement the ability to sign in and out/ hold a seeded database using firebase, with the amount of work done know this is most definitely a stretch goal.



If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Soundcloud API so users can add music to plans.
Possibly authentication so users can have accounts
I think pictures for workouts wont be a problem, but possibly adding videos to the site (I have absolutely no idea how to do that so we will see)

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
Again Soundcloud API requires an API
I haven't dabbled to far into react besides what is taught in the lessons. 
firebase
I've been looking into firebase quite a bit and I think implanting that will make the product able to use full CRUD which is now my stretch goal. I think if I can get the main goal up and running. I can mess around with adding a database so user can store information and possibly come back to where ever the site is hosted for them. So it can actually have some real world use.

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
Im excited to have creative control over something! I think a lot of the stuff i need to do is going to make more sense to me as I start implementing them.

NOTES FOR CAPSTONE STUDY AND PURPOSE.



Function components are literally functions that returns a React element. They can't store or alter state. We will mostly write function components.

Class components are classes that extend React's Component class. They must always include a render() method that will return a React element. They are used when we need state.

Nesting components is a big part of developing with React. Components can be parents, siblings, children or any combination thereof.

Small, modular components are the way to go. This makes our code easier to understand and allows us to separate presentational concerns.


NOTES on State:
state is anything that will be stored and changed.
adding new workouts is a change of state.

State can be changed props can not (at least components can not change the its props)

only define components as classes if it 100% requires state.

Local state will live inside a single component so only in the component that is using it.

Workout Control will be parent component of everything
it will need a class component.

https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/react-fundamentals/planning-our-application-part-2
Starting at 3:14pm - 5 pm: educating myself on state more, to further plan how my project will interact component wise.

(Date not sure forgot to list)

5:30pm - 5:50 pm started to plan out authentication with react
9pm - 9:45 continued to watch video

React Hooks Course - All React Hooks Explained

doing extra study to see if I wanna end implementing other features and comparing that to if I will have enough time.


Honestly reconsidering building the structure of my website from scratch, there seem to be easier was in react then I am going about things.

___________________________________________________________
                    TODOLIST

1)  Get Base site running !CHECK!

2)  Have seeded workout already so users can choose a list. without having to create any work outs.
6)  Create a personal plan section.
7)  Users can add a personalized list of workouts in a workout plan section.
8)  Users can access the soundcloud API to add mixes to their personal workout page.
9)  figure out what the heck is going on with using the soundcloud API
10) have the music section be interwoven with the personal page. 

11) styling (not sure on when i should try implementing) !CHECK!
