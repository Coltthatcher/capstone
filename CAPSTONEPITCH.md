_GOAL_

GOAl was inspired by that feeling when you go to workout and have no idea what to do. Machine you wanted to use taken? at home no equipment? 

GOAL is web and mobile subscription based app that integrates a database so users can can make personalized workout plans, that fit their lifestyle.

Starting this project took a while I restarted three separate times!

## MVP


Goal will have a working app page, there will be a homepage, and information on how to subscribe. The sites purpose will be presented. Users will be able to add personalized workouts to personalized plan or choose from seeded workouts.
Original plan was to just have information disappear and not have a database, but as the project progressed I realized I wanted one to actually make a useable product.

* Page for workouts, users have ability to add, edit, delete new workouts
* Users can add workouts to a personal page

## Process 

* I found once I started creating something that looked good, I found the inspiration for how I would implement my functionality.

* I restarted the project three separate times, In retrospect i would have maybe taken to drawing my page out atheistically wise, then built it with that in mind earlier.

* Find inspiration in your favorite projects/apps
once i started thinking like a front end coder, and looking at other projects, things started flying smoothly.

* Sometimes you get stretch goals implementing but not your mvp LOL

## next time

* Start and stick to a plan earlier. I didn't fully achieve my mvp, I did end up implementing (not fully ) some of my stretch goals.

* Spend a day being artistic and creating a website on paper, then translate that to code. (did this in the end wish i did it earlier)

* Start with the parts you enjoy, once I got in a grove and started enjoying what I was making my capstone stopped being a chore. I think if i started with css earlier I would have gotten more done.
