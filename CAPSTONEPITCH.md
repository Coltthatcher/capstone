GOAl was inspired by that feeling when you go to workout and have no idea what to do. Machine you wanted to use taken? at home no equipment? 

GOAL is web and mobile subscription based app that integrates a database so users can can make personalized workout plans, that fit their lifestyle.

Starting this project took a while I restarted three separate times!

## MVP


Goal will have a working app page, there will be a homepage, and information on how to subscribe. The sites purpose will be presented. Users will be able to add personalized workouts to personalized plan or choose from seeded workouts.
Original plan was to just have information disappear and not have a database, but as the project progressed I realized I wanted one to actually make a useable product.

* Page for workouts, users have ability to add new workouts
* Users can add workouts to a personal page
